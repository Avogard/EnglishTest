# EnglishTest
This is the adaptive test, designed to assess your English level quickly and efficiently on a CEFR scale (A1-C2). It uses Python (Flask) for backend, and Numpy for calculating 
your level. This test is fast because it adapts to user's level and suggests the most appropriate words. 

# Development
It is a collaborative project and it's currently in develoment. Future tasks - finish site (https://catenglishtest.herokuapp.com/hello - at the moment it's incomplete) to collect 
data and use it for future development.
