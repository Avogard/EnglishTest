# EnglishTest - https://catenglishtest.web.app/
This is the adaptive test, designed to assess your English level quickly and efficiently on a CEFR scale (A1-C2). It uses Python (Flask) for backend, and Numpy for calculating 
your level. This test is fast because it adapts to user's level and suggests the most appropriate words.
